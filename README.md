# PDF Brochure Maker

A simple quick & dirty **web-based PDF brochure maker** hosted on **GitHub Pages**. This tool allows users to design and generate **custom PDF brochures** directly from their browser. I put this together to help a buddy who was struggling to keep their personal store brochures maintained. I didn't spend much time on this, but it works surprisingly well for being a simple piece of technology. Some customizations and such as lacking, but happy to accept PRs if anyone has anything fun.
